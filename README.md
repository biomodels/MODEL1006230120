**Abstract:**   
Compared to complex structural Huxley-type models, Hill-type models
phenomenologically describe muscle contraction using only few state variables.
The Hill-type models dominate in the ever expanding field of musculoskeletal
simulations for simplicity and low computational cost. Reasonable parameters
are required to gain insight into mechanics of movement. The two most common
Hill-type muscle models used contain three components. The series elastic
component is connected in series to the contractile component. A parallel
elastic component is either connected in parallel to both the contractile and
the series elastic component (model [CC+SEC]), or is connected in parallel
only with the contractile component (model [CC]). As soon as at least one of
the components exhibits substantial nonlinearities, as, e.g., the contractile
component by the ability to turn on and off, the two models are mechanically
different. We tested which model ([CC+SEC] or [CC]) represents the cat soleus
better. Ramp experiments consisting of an isometric and an isokinetic part
were performed with an in situ cat soleus preparation using supramaximal nerve
stimulation. Hill-type models containing force-length and force-velocity
relationship, excitation-contraction coupling and series and parallel elastic
force-elongation relations were fitted to the data. To test which model might
represent the muscle better, the obtained parameters were compared with
experimentally determined parameters. Determined in situations with negligible
passive force, the force-velocity relation and the series elastic component
relation are independent of the chosen model. In contrast to model [CC+SEC],
these relations predicted by model [CC] were in accordance with experimental
relations. In conclusion model [CC] seemed to better represent the cat soleus
contraction dynamics and should be preferred in the nonlinear regression of
muscle parameters and in musculoskeletal modeling.
